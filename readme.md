## Sign up flow

The path through the sign up flow is managed by [Machi](https://github.com/josephluck/machi), a state machine library I wrote to manage complex data-driven flows through UI.

A graphical representation of the sign up flow can be generated by running:

```bash
yarn generate-sign-up-flow-chart
```

Which outputs:

![sign up flow](https://github.com/josephluck/urban-jungle/blob/master/app/sign-up-flow.png?raw=true)
