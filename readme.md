# Features

## Plants

Store your collection of plants in Urban Jungle, along with care instructions, photos and, of course, their names.

## Plant identification

Got a new plant? Snap a picture of it and Urban Jungle will fill in the rest using snazzy image recognition.

## Reminders

Save reminders for your care instructions. Urban Jungle will ping you when you need to care for your plants.

## Sharing

Make a household and invite others to care for your plants too. Sharing is caring.

## Password-less login

Hate passwords? Me too. Urban Jungle lets you sign in using your phone number (or e-mail address & password if you'd rather).

## State management

Global state management is managed using [Stately](https://github.com/josephluck/machi), a state management library I wrote to provide simple fully-typesafe state management for React.

## Form state management

Forms are managed using a custom hook specific for this library. You can [read all about it](https://josephluck.co.uk/blog/building-forms-and-validation/) if you want.

## Styling

Styled components

## Sign up flow

The path through the sign up flow is managed by [Machi](https://github.com/josephluck/machi), a state machine library I wrote to manage complex data-driven flows through UI. It's perfect for sign-up / onboarding journeys like Urban Jungles.

A graphical representation of the sign up flow can be generated by running:

```bash
yarn generate-sign-up-flow-chart
```

Which outputs:
