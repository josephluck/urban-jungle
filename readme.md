# Features

## Beautiful design

Urban Jungle has been designed with simplicity and beauty in mind for effortless plant caring.

## Plants

Add all your plants, give them names, locations and nice pictures.

## Reminders

Reminders to care for your plants are what Urban Jungle is all about! Add multiple reminders per plant, at different schedules.

## More

Many more features are planned and if you feel like lending a hand, feel free to contribute to any of the open issues.

Feel free to request new features too, but please bear in mind that this is a personal side project with a very specific purpose, so I might not agree with and/or build everything!
